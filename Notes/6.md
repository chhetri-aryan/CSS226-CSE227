# What is an Android LifeCycle
The Android activity lifecycle is a sequence of states an activity goes through from its creation to its destruction. Understanding these states helps in managing the app's behavior and resources effectively. Here's an overview of each lifecycle method:

1. **`onCreate()`**:
   - Called when the activity is first created.
   - Used for initializing components, setting up UI (e.g., `setContentView()`), and restoring the activity's previous state (if any).

2. **`onStart()`**:
   - Called when the activity is becoming visible to the user.
   - The activity is now visible but not yet interactive.

3. **`onResume()`**:
   - Called when the activity starts interacting with the user.
   - The activity is now in the foreground and the user can interact with it.

4. **`onPause()`**:
   - Called when the system is about to pause the activity (e.g., when another activity comes in front).
   - Used to save UI state, pause animations, or other resources that are not needed when the activity is not in the foreground.

5. **`onStop()`**:
   - Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user.
   - The activity may be killed by the system to free up resources.

6. **`onRestart()`**:
   - Called after the activity has been stopped, just before it is started again.
   - It can be used to re-initialize resources that were released during `onStop()`.

7. **`onDestroy()`**:
   - Called before the activity is destroyed.
   - Final cleanup tasks are performed here, such as releasing resources.

**Lifecycle Flow Example**:
- When the activity is launched, it transitions from `onCreate()` → `onStart()` → `onResume()`.
- When the activity is interrupted (e.g., a phone call), it moves from `onPause()` → `onStop()`.
- If the activity returns to the foreground, it goes from `onRestart()` → `onStart()` → `onResume()`.
- If the activity is finished or destroyed by the system, it goes through `onPause()` → `onStop()` → `onDestroy()`.

**Key Points**:
- **`onCreate()`** and **`onDestroy()`** are called once in an activity's lifetime.
- **`onStart()`**, **`onStop()`**, **`onPause()`**, and **`onResume()`** can be called multiple times during the lifecycle.
- Proper management of these methods ensures efficient resource usage and a smooth user experience.
