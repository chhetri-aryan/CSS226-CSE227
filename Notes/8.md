# Types Of Intent

In Android, intents are used to request an action from another app component. There are two main types of intents:

### 1. **Explicit Intent**:
   - **Purpose**: Used to launch a specific component (e.g., activity, service) within the same application.
   - **How it Works**: You explicitly specify the target component's class name in the intent.
   - **Use Case**: When you know exactly which activity or service you want to start. For example, navigating from `MainActivity` to `DetailsActivity`.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, DetailsActivity.class);
   startActivity(intent);
   ```

### 2. **Implicit Intent**:
   - **Purpose**: Used to request an action without specifying the exact component that should handle it. The Android system matches the intent with a component (activity, service) capable of performing the action.
   - **How it Works**: You specify the action you want to perform (e.g., viewing a webpage, sending an email) and the system finds an appropriate app to handle the request.
   - **Use Case**: When you want to perform a general action like opening a web page, sending an SMS, or capturing a photo, and let the system determine which app can fulfill the request.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
   intent.setData(Uri.parse("https://www.example.com"));
   startActivity(intent);
   ```

### Other Intent Variants:
- **Broadcast Intent**:
  - **Purpose**: Used to broadcast a message to multiple components (e.g., system-wide events like battery low).
  - **Use Case**: Sending system-wide broadcast messages that can be received by multiple components.

  **Example**:
  ```java
  Intent intent = new Intent("com.example.CUSTOM_BROADCAST");
  sendBroadcast(intent);
  ```

- **Sticky Intent**:
  - **Purpose**: A type of broadcast intent that persists after it has been broadcast, allowing others to retrieve it later.
  - **Use Case**: Typically used for system events like battery levels. They are rarely used in normal app development.

- **Pending Intent**:
  - **Purpose**: A token that you give to another application (e.g., NotificationManager, AlarmManager) to allow it to perform an action on your appâ€™s behalf at a later time.
  - **Use Case**: Scheduling future actions, like firing an intent when a notification is clicked.

  **Example**:
  ```java
  Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, AlarmReceiver.class);
  PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, 0);
  ```

**Key Points**:
- **Explicit Intents** are used within the same app.
- **Implicit Intents** are used when you need the system to find an appropriate app to handle the intent.
- Choosing the correct type of intent ensures that your app interacts with other apps and components as intended.
