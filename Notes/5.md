# What is localDatabase in Android

A local database in Android is a database stored on the device itself, allowing apps to store and manage data locally without needing an internet connection. The most common local database used in Android is SQLite, a lightweight, embedded database engine that provides a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store structured data.
